This repo contains some small tools and scripts that I use all the time.
All of them are targeted for MacOS / Linux shells.

## `prettierinit`

Adds prettier to an existing _yarn_ project.

- install prettier
- create a `.prettierrc.json` with my preferred settings
- configure git hooks to run prettier automatically

## `create-react-app`

Creates a basic react app with my preferred settings and tools. Not to be confused with
the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)
tool that was once the official tool to setup react apps.

- create a yarn project with vite.js and react-ts template
- add prettier (see "prettierinit")
- setup gitignore
