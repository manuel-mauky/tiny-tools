This repo contains some small tools and scripts that I use all the time.
All of them are targeted for MacOS / Linux shells.

## `prettierinit`

Adds prettier to an existing _yarn_ project. It will:

- install prettier
- create a `.prettierrc.json` with my preferred settings
- configure git hooks to run prettier automatically
